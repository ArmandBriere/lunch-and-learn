## Objective of the presentation

Golang is not very popular

- Why?

After a few minutes of Google research we can see that big companies are using it

- Uber created their geofence service in Go
- Google created the language and created Kubernetes with it
- Twitch use it to reduce latency
- Netflix use it for high performance proxy

All of those application have a few things in common

- They need speed
- They need to be fast
- They need to scale
- Developers want to have fun

## Any requirements?

Is there any requirements to understand this presentation?

- I expect a small Python and linux knowledge
- I will do my best to explain every technologies
- The slides will be available online after the presentation with all the source code I present here today

### What's my background?

I started coding 8 years ago with a Matlab class and I didn't understand anything at all.

I was playing a lot of video game, I was part of the univertisy esport team. At that time we wanted to record our gameplay and save it on YouTube.

I talked to a friend about that idea and he told me we could do it ourself with code. He decided to teach me Python.

I learned python classes by creating a small Battleship game on Windows running on Powershell. Then we looked at the YouTube Python API on how to upload video to the platform.

What did I learn from that project?

- I thought that programming was hard but it isn't
- I didn't understand API, video chunk, command line or how to install package in Python
- You need help to learn and progress
- We had a working version after a few days of coding together

After that I've done a bachelor in computer science and a Master degree in AI

All of that to say that I have more knowledge in Python but it didn't stop me to increase AI inference performance by 30% at work

## Tools we are going to use

Of course, we will look at the two main programming language

- Python
- Golang

We will also look at

- OpenCV
- Yolo

If we have time we will look into the Cloud integration

- Google Cloud
- Terraform
