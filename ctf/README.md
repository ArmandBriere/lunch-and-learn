# CTF - Let's start hacking

---

![bg w:50%](./assets/ctf_background.jpeg)

---

## Objectives

---

1. What is Cybersecurity?

2. What is a CTF?

3. Poke your curiosity

---

# What is Cybersecurity?

---

> Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use

[America's cyber defense agency](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/what-cybersecurity)

---

## That's a boring definition

---

> Did you lock door before leaving this morning?

Me

---

Yes?

---

## As developers do we apply the same safety on our code?

---

Data encryption?
Do we salt password?
Is my code safe from race condition?
SQL injection?
Am I using liblzma 5.6.0?
Am I using Sudo-1.8.27?
Buffer overflow?
XSS?
...

# CTF

---

## Capture The Flag (CTF) is ethical hacking

---

# Bug bounty = üí∞

# CTF = üö©

---

## You are allowed to break things in a CTF

### Go find the admin password!

---

# Rules

---

1. Do not cheat, you are not learning that way

2. Don't prevent other people from having fun or preventing our problems from functioning.

3. A flag is a string of text matching this regex: `osedea{[a-zA-Z0-9\_-]*}`

4. Find a flag and get some points üíØ
